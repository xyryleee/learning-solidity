## Join the workshop (optional)

Want to be listed as a participant? Get a copy of this repo on your machine and add yourself to the roster.

- **Get the repo:** Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (and [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) if you like), then click **Fork** on this repo and clone your fork:

  `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/avalanche-smart-contract-starter.git`

- **Add yourself:** In **Workshop participants** below, add one line with your name, GitHub handle, and what you do (e.g. developer, student). Save `README.md`.

- **Send it back:** From the repo root run:

  `git add . && git commit -m "Add myself to workshop participants" && git push origin main`

  Then open a Pull Request into this repo. Use a title like: **Add [Your Name] to participants**.

## Submit your exercises

Complete the exercises in the **`exercises/`** folder (Token, Staking, etc.) and submit your work via Pull Request.

**How to submit:**

1. Fork this repo and clone your fork.
2. Solve the exercises in the `exercises/` subfolders (token, staking, nft, voting, escrow, multisig, auction, timelock). Each contract has TODOs only—you write the code.
3. Commit and push to your fork.
4. Open a **Pull Request** from your fork to this repo. Use a title like: **Your Name | Exercise submission (Token, Staking)**.

## Exercise folders

| Folder | Topic | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [exercises/token/](exercises/token/) | Token | ERC20-style token: balanceOf, transfer |
| [exercises/staking/](exercises/staking/) | Staking | Stake AVAX and withdraw later |
| [exercises/nft/](exercises/nft/) | NFT | Mint and transfer (ERC721-style) |
| [exercises/voting/](exercises/voting/) | Voting | On-chain proposals and voting |
| [exercises/escrow/](exercises/escrow/) | Escrow | Hold funds; release to beneficiary |
| [exercises/multisig/](exercises/multisig/) | Multisig | N-of-M owners approve then execute |
| [exercises/auction/](exercises/auction/) | Auction | Highest bid wins; owner ends auction |
| [exercises/timelock/](exercises/timelock/) | Timelock | Withdraw only after a delay |

Each folder has a `README.md` (requirements) and a `.sol` file with **TODOs only**—no solution code. Implement the logic, deploy to Fuji, and share your contract address in the PR.

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env   # then add your PRIVATE_KEY
pnpm run compile
pnpm run test
```

**Get testnet AVAX (Fuji):** [Fuji faucet](https://faucet.avax.network/) — send to the **wallet address** that matches your `PRIVATE_KEY`.

## Deploy & test (full guide)

All deployment options (local Hardhat, Fuji, mainnet), **`learning/` folder paths and contract names**, verification, unit tests, and Hardhat console / troubleshooting are in:

**[guide.md](./guide.md)**
